# Poll Application - Django Tutorial

Welcome to the Poll Application, a simple Django-based project created to demonstrate the basics of Django web development. This repository is based on the Django 4.2 tutorial and covers the creation of a basic poll application. The application consists of two main parts:

1. **Public Site**: Allows users to view polls and vote.
2. **Admin Site**: Allows admins to add, change, and delete polls.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Django 4.2 or later

Ensure that Django is installed by running:

```bash
$ python -m django --version
```

If Django is not installed, please refer to the [Django installation guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/install/).

## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Django Project**:
   From your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to store your project and run:

   ```bash
   $ django-admin startproject mysite
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   $ cd mysite
   ```

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   $ python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to verify the project setup.

## Creating the Polls App

1. **Create an App**:
   In the root directory of your project (where `manage.py` is located), run:

   ```bash
   $ python manage.py startapp polls
   ```

2. **Define the Polls Views**:
   In `polls/views.py`, create a simple view:

   ```python
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def index(request):
       return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
   ```

3. **Map the URL to the View**:
   In `polls/urls.py`, map the view to a URL:

   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', views.index, name='index'),
   ]
   ```

   Include this URL configuration in your project's `urls.py`:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import include, path

   urlpatterns = [
       path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
   ]
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   Start the server again to test the polls app:

   ```bash
   $ python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/` to see your app in action.

## Setting Up the Database

1. **Configure the Database**:
   Open `mysite/settings.py` and ensure the `DATABASES` setting is configured. The default is SQLite, which is sufficient for this tutorial.

2. **Create Database Migrations**:
   Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Define Models**:
   In `polls/models.py`, define your database models:

   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class Question(models.Model):
       question_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')

   class Choice(models.Model):
       question = models.ForeignKey(Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       choice_text = models.CharField(max_length=200)
       votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations**:
   After defining models, run:

   ```bash
   $ python manage.py makemigrations polls
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Admin Site

1. **Create a Superuser**:
   To access the admin site, create a superuser:

   ```bash
   $ python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

2. **Register Models in Admin**:
   In `polls/admin.py`, register your models:

   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from .models import Question

   admin.site.register(Question)
   ```

3. **Access the Admin Site**:
   Start the development server and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. Log in with the superuser credentials to manage your polls.

## Exploring the API

You can explore the Django ORM through the Django shell:

```bash
$ python manage.py shell
```

Within the shell, you can interact with your models:

```python
from polls.models import Question, Choice
Question.objects.all()
```

## Conclusion

This poll application provides a foundational understanding of how to build web applications with Django. The concepts covered here include setting up Django projects and apps, managing databases with models and migrations, and utilizing Djangoâ€™s powerful admin interface.
